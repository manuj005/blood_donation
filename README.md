I participated in a competition hosted by DrivenData.org which required to predict Blood Donation for various participants. My rank was 578/3466. 

I used some outlier removal, made various classification models like SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayse. After checking accuracy with all the above listed models, I went ahead with Logistic Regression as it was giving the best accuracy.
